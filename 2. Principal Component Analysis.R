## there seems to be some severe collinearity!

# If any of the correlations are too high (say above .9), you may need to remove one of the variables from 
# the analysis, as the two variables seem to be measuring the same thing.  Another alternative would be to 
# combine the variables in some way (perhaps by taking the average).  If the correlations are too low, say 
# below .1, then one or more of the variables might load only onto one principal component (in other words,
# make its own principal component).  This is not helpful, as the whole point of the analysis is to 
# reduce the number of items (variables).
